FutileTemplate
==============

Bash script and template Futile/Unity project to allow for quick Futile project setup.

How to use this:

* Clone/download the repo somewhere local.
* Create a new, empty project directly outside the template folder.
* Open a terminal on your Mac.
* Navigate to the repo directory.
* Execute the createfutileproj command, as appropriate. See usage:

Usage:

    createfutileproj [-c futile_path] [-f futile_path] directory_name
    Note: use one of -c OR -f, not both.

    -c, --clone futile_path
        Clone Futile from github to a location (NOT the project directory) before copying relevant files to the project.

    -f, --futile futile_path
        Use a local copy of Futile. This should point to the root Futile folder in the local repo (the one that contains FutileProject).

    directory_name
        Where you want to create the new project. NOTE: This does not create a new dir, it puts the files IN the directory specified.

Examples:

    mkdir ../MyNewGame
    ./createfutileproj -f ../Futile ../MyNewGame

    mkdir ../MyNewGame
    ./createfutileproj -c ../Futile ../MyNewGame

Notes:

The script requires that the project directory is already created in case you need to set up git/svn/etc on the project directory first.
